# Crypto-Asset-Optimizer
Crypto Asset Optimizer
A smart tool for analyzing, balancing, and improving the efficiency of your cryptocurrency portfolio.

Do you manage multiple wallets, tokens, and protocols? Do you spend hours on manual analysis to figure out where to go next? Crypto Asset Optimizer is a professional open-source solution that turns scattered data about your assets into a clear strategy for their growth and protection.

We provide you with not just information, but ready-made analytical conclusions for making informed decisions.

Key features
Single Dashboard: Aggregate data from all your wallets and exchanges in one interface. See the full picture of your crypto wealth in real time: distribution, profit/loss (PnL), liquidity.

Risk and volatility analysis: The system assesses the concentration of risks in specific tokens or blockchains, warns of high asset volatility, and helps identify imbalances in your portfolio.

Smart rebalancing recommendations: Based on your chosen strategy (conservative, balanced, aggressive), the tool suggests tactical steps: which tokens to partially sell and which to buy more of in order to return the portfolio to its target allocation.

Yield & Staking Scan: Automatically scans your assets for available options to earn passive income: staking, providing liquidity (LP) in reliable pools, lending protocols. Compares expected returns (APY) and risks.

Gas & Fee Optimizer: Analyzes upcoming transactions and recommends the optimal time to execute them based on network congestion to minimize gas fees.

Secure Strategy Simulator: Test any rebalancing or investment idea in an isolated simulation to see potential outcomes without making real transactions.

How it works and security
Read-only public data: Only the public addresses of your wallets and the public APIs of exchanges are used for analysis. We receive data about balances and transactions, but we do not have access to manage funds.

Key principle: “Read-Only”: The program CANNOT initiate transactions, withdraw funds, or request your private keys, seed phrases, or passwords. Your assets are physically protected by this architectural solution.

Local processing of confidential data: All sensitive data (address lists, read-only exchange API keys) is stored and processed only on your local device in encrypted form. No confidential information is transferred to external servers.

Complete transparency: Open source code allows any expert to verify the analysis logic and ensure that there are no hidden or malicious functions.

Who is Crypto Asset Optimizer designed for?
Long-term investors (HODLers) who want to systematically manage their portfolio, rather than simply store it.

Active traders and DeFi users who need a single control center for disparate assets on different platforms.

Financially literate crypto enthusiasts seeking to diversify and optimize their returns.

Newbies who want to start their journey with the right portfolio management habits, avoiding emotional decisions.
